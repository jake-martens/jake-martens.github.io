    <p>Hi! I'm Jake, and this is my website. It's pretty new.</p>
    <p>I'm a alumnus of Carleton College where I graduated cum laude in 2022 with a degree in Mathematics.
        While there, I also studied Arabic and Middle East Studies.

    <p>
        These days I'm living in Minneapolis, MN and working at Concord, an IT consulting firm out in the suburbs.
