    <p>Hi! I'm Jake, and this is my website. It's pretty new.</p>
    <p>I'm an alumnus of <a href="https://www.carleton.edu">Carleton College</a> where I graduated cum laude in 2022 with a degree in Mathematics.
        While there, I also studied Arabic and Middle East Studies.
    </p>
    <p>
        These days I'm living in Minneapolis, MN and working at <a href="https://www.concordusa.com">Concord</a>, an IT consulting firm out in the suburbs.
